# Modeling Attention and Binding in the Brain through Bidirectional Recurrent Gating

This is the code code repository for the paper [Modeling Attention and Binding in the Brain through Bidirectional Recurrent Gating](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.09.612033)

### Pre-trained models
Pre-trained models with the parameters used to train them are in the pretrained directory. For each experiment, the results could be reproduced by running the corresponding notebook.

### COCO experiment
For the COCO experiment, the COCO python tools (pycocotools) should be installed inside the src folder (see [COCO-API](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi)).
